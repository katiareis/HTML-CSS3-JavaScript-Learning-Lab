    <h1>Basic JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages
      interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with
      HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in
      JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and
      strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops,
      if/else statements, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>Comment Your JavaScript Code</h2>
    <p>
      Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
      Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people
      who will later need to figure out what that code does.
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
    <p>
      Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the
      current line. This is an in-line comment:
    </p>
    <pre>
      // This is an in-line comment.
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */.
      This is a multi-line comment:
    </p>
    <pre>
      /* This is a
      multi-line comment */
    </pre>
    <p>
      NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the
      function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the
      intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.
