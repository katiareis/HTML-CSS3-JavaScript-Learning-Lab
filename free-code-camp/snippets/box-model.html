      Basic CSS - The Box Model All HTML elements are essentially little
      rectangles. These elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term
      "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box
      model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It
      consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Three
      important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element:
      padding, border, and margin. An element's padding controls the amount of
      space between the element's content and its border. Here, we can see that
      the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that
      the red box has more padding than the blue box. When you increase the blue
      box's padding, it will increase the distance (padding) between the text
      and the border around it. Explanation of the different parts: Content -
      The content of the box, where text and images appear Padding - Clears an
      area around the content. The padding is transparent Border - A border that
      goes around the padding and content Margin - Clears an area outside the
      border. The margin is transparent The box model allows us to add a border
      around elements, and to define space between elements. Sometimes you will
      want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of padding,
      margin or border on each of its sides. CSS allows you to control the
      padding of all four individual sides of an element with the padding-top,
      padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties. CSS allows you
      to control the margin of all four individual sides of an element with the
      margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties.
      Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right,
      padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, you can specify
      them all in one line, like this: padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; Let's try
      this again, but with margin this time. Instead of specifying an element's
      margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties
      individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this: margin:
      10px 20px 10px 20px; These four values work like a clock: top, right,
      bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the
      side-specific margin instructions. These four values work like a clock:
      top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using
      the side-specific padding instructions.

      .injected-text {
        margin-bottom: -25px;
        text-align: center;

      .box {
        border-style: solid;
        border-color: black;
        border-width: 5px;
        text-align: center;
      }

      .yellow-box {
        background-color: yellow;
        padding: 10px;
      }

      .red-box {
        background-color: crimson;
        color: #fff;
        padding: 1.5em;
      }

      .blue-box {
        background-color: blue;
        color: #fff;
        padding: 20px;
