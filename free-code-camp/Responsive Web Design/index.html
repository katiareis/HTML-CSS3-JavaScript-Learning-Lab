    <!--  Basic CSS - HTML class Attribute
    The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

    Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
    Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

    Here's an example CSS class declaration:

    <style>
      .blue-text {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>

    You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. 
    
    You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>. 
      
    Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

    -->

    <h1 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Basic CSS</h2>

    <!-- Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red.

    Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of red-text.
    -->
