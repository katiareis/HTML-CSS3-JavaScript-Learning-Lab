    <!--  Basic CSS - Setting height and width

    The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
    The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

    The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

    Size Your Images

    CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

    For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:

    <style>
      .larger-image {
        width: 500px;
      }
    </style>

    CSS height and width Values
    The height and width properties may have the following values:

    auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
    length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.
    % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
    initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
    inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

    Setting max-width
    The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

    The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).    

    Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, and the value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be used (and the width property will be ignored).
