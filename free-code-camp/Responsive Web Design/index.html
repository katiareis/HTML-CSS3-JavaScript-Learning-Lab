    <!--  Basic CSS
    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements.

    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

    Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

    Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS.

    - Internal CSS
    An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
    An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

    CSS Selectors to Style Elements

    With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

    When you entered <h2 style="color: red;"></h2>, you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

    That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

    At the top of your code, create a style block like this:

    <style>
    </style>
    Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

    <style>
      h2 {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>

    Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.

    <h1 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Basic CSS</h2>

    <!-- Create a CSS style block. Add the necessary CSS to turn all h2 elements blue.
