    <!--  Add Images to Your Website
    All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

    Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.

    Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed. -->

    <!-- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

    Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

    The <img> tag has two required attributes:

    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed -->

    <main>
      <img
        src="https://www.bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"
        alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
