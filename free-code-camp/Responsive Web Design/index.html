    You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action attribute on your form element.

    For example:

    <form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data">
      <input>
    </form>

    -->

    <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to HTML5 Elements</h2>

    <!-- -Nest the existing input element inside a form element and assign "https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo" to the action attribute of the form element.
