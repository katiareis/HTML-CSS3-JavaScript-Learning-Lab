    <!--  Basic CSS - Cascading Order

    What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

    All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

    Inline style (inside an HTML element)
    External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
    Browser default
    So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

    Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.

    For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.

    Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink, then apply it to an element. Will our class override the body element's color: green; CSS property?    
       
    -->

    <h1 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h1>
    <h2 class="pink-text blue-text">Basic CSS</h2>

    <!--  Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink and aplly it on h2 element.
    
    Our pink-text class overrode our body element's CSS declaration!

    We just proved that our classes will override the body element's CSS. So the next logical question is, what can we do to override our pink-text class?

    Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration.

    Apply the blue-text class to your h2 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.

    Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:

    class="class1 class2"
    Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

    However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text
