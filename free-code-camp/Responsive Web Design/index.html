    <!--  Basic CSS - Absolute versus Relative Units
    
      CSS Units
    
    CSS has several different units for expressing a length. Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc. Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

    The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with pixels (px). Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to px, CSS has a number of different length unit options that you can use.

    The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. 
    
    Absolute Lengths
    The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

    Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

    Relative Lengths
    
    Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scales better between different rendering mediums.

    Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.

    Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
    * Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.
