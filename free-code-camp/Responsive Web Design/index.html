    <!--  Radio Buttons.

    You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.

    Radio buttons are a type of input.

    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.

    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.

    Here's an example of a radio button:

    <label> 
      <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
    </label>

    It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the related input element. For example:

    <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
    <label for="indoor">Indoor</label>
    
    We can also nest the input element within the label tags:

    <label for="indoor"> 
      <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
    </label>

    <!-- Add a pair of radio buttons to your form, each nested in its own label element. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor. Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor to create a radio group.
