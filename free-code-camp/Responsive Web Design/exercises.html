    <!-- Applied Visual Design - CSS Fixed Position
    
    CSS Layout - The position Property
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

    There are five different position values:

    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

      position: fixed;
    An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

    A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

    | Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

    The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

    One key difference between the fixed and absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

    The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of navbar. Change its position to fixed, and offset it 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left. After you have added the code, scroll the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place.
