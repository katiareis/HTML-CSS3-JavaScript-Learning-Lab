    <!-- Applied Visual Design - CSS Relative Position
    
    CSS Layout - The position Property
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

    There are five different position values:

    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

    - Change an Element's Relative Position

    CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

    When the position of an element is set to relative, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of left or right, and top or bottom. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

    p {
      position: relative;
      bottom: 10px;
    }
    Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

    Note: Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

    |Change the position of the h2 to relative, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the top of where it sits in the normal flow. Notice there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements.


    - Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets
    
    The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

    | Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.

    <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
