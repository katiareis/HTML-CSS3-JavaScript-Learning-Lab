    <!-- Applied Visual Design - CSS Absolute Position
    
    CSS Layout - The position Property
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

    There are five different position values:

    static
    relative
    fixed
    absolute
    sticky
    Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.

    position: absolute;
    
    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

    Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

    - Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning

    The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

    One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

    | Lock the #searchbar element to the top-right of its section parent by declaring its position as absolute. Give it top and right offsets of 50 pixels each.
